# Distributed Game of Life

**Description:**

This distributed version of John Conway's Game of Life, utilizing message passing, semaphores, and synchronization. Depending the size of the board it is divided up amongst a user predefined number of threads, which communicate with the main thread through message passing, allowing synchronization between each generation. With semaphores protecting shared recorces and processes when communicating between threads.

**Features:**

**Distributed Computation** Utilizes multiple threads to parallelize the evaluation of cells for each generation.

**Synchronization** - Employs semaphores and message passing for coordination between threads and generations.

**File Input for Initial Configuration**
- Reads the initial configuration of organisms (Generation 0) from an ASCII text file.

**Configurable via Command Line Arguments**
- Accepts 3-5 command line arguments for customization:
    - Number of threads
    - File containing Generation 0
    - Number of generations to play
    - Option to print each generation (default is *False*)
    - Option for keyboard input before proceeding (default is *False*)

## Example Run:
##### $ ls -1d /dev/* | ./SRH thread 4
<p>
Bad Files: 0<br>
Directories: 17<br>
Regular Files: 1<br>
Special Files: 183<br>
Regular File Bytes: 79671296<br>
Text Files: 0<br>
Text File Bytes: 0<br>

$ </p>
## Compilation:

To compile the program with the multi-threaded architecture, use the **makefile** or use the following command:<br>
**make clean**<br>
**make**<br>

***or***

**$ g++ -o proj4 proj4.cpp -lpthread**

## Usage:

### Serial Architecture:

In the serial architecture version, the program reads file names from standard input, processes them sequentially, and provides the required file statistics. To run the program in serial mode:


<h6>$ ./SRH</h6>

Enter file names one per line. Press ***Ctrl + D*** to signal the end of input.


**or**

Piper in the ***ls*** command into the SRH, by:


<h6>$ ls -1d* | ./SRH</h6>

### Multi-Threaded Architecture:

The multi-threaded architecture allows for concurrent handling of file requests. To use this mode, include the argument thread followed by the maximum number of threads to execute at a time.


###### $ ./SRH thread ***[max_threads]***
<p>
Example, to run with at most 10 threads:</p>

**$ ./SRH thread 10**
<p>
Enter file names as in serial mode. Press Ctrl + D to signal the end of input.
</p>

**or**
<p>
Piper in the <strong>ls -1d*</strong> command into the SRH, by:
</p>

<h6>$ ls -1d* | ./SRH thread 10</h6>
           
## Output:
<p>
The program will provide statistics for each file, including the number of bad files, directories, regular files, special files, total bytes used, and more.

Ensure that the pthread library is available.
