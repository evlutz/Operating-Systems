# Distributed Game of Life

**Description:**

This distributed version of John Conway's Game of Life, utilizing message passing, semaphores, and synchronization. Depending the size of the board it is divided up amongst a user predefined number of threads, which communicate with the main thread through message passing, allowing synchronization between each generation. With semaphores protecting shared recorces and processes when communicating between threads.

**Features:**

- Distributed Computation allows multiple threads to parallelize the evaluation of cells for each generation.

- Implements John Conwayâ€™s Game of Life *[learn more](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/science/math-conway-game-of-life.html).*

- Message passing implements synchronization of threads between each generation

- Semaphores protect shared data while sending messages between threads.

- File Input for initial generation


## Example Run:
##### $ ./game_of_life 10 glider_gun.txt 120 y y
![Alt Text](LifeRun.gif)

## Compilation:

To compile the `game_of_life` with header files and abstracts, use the **makefile** or use the following command:<br>
- **make clean**<br>
- **make**<br>

***or***

- **$ g++ -o -pthread life.cpp life.h AbstractLife.h -o game_of_life**

## Usage:
###### $ ./game_of_life [*# Threads*] [*File name*] [*# of generations*]   *Optional:*{Print generations?} *Optional:*{Wait for input}

**Configurable Command Line Arguments**
- Accepts 3-5 command line arguments for customization:
    - Number of threads
    - File containing Generation 0
    - Number of generations to play
    - Option to print each generation (default is *False*)
    - Option for keyboard input before proceeding (default is *False*)

#### Game Boards

Game boards can be created by ant user, it consists of a grid of 1's and 0's which cannot be more than 40 rows or columns.
1's represent alive cells and 0's represent deadcells.

To create a gameboard simply create a text file and create or edit the pre installed grids under the `Starting_Boards` directory
           
## Output:
<p>
The program will provide statistics for each file, including the number of bad files, directories, regular files, special files, total bytes used, and more.

Ensure that the pthread library is available.
